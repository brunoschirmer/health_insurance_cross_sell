## This project aims to order a potential client list by propensity score

#### This project was made by Bruno Schirmer.

# 1. Business Problem.

Insurance All is a company that provides vehicle insurance to its customers and the product team is analyzing the possibility of offering policyholders a new product: health insurance.

As with vehicle insurance, customers of this new health insurance plan need to pay an amount annually to Insurance All to obtain an amount insured by the company, intended for the costs of an eventual accident or damage to the vehicle.

Insurance All conducted a survey of about 380,000 customers about their interest in joining a new health insurance product last year. All customers expressed interest or not in purchasing health insurance and these responses were saved in a database along with other customer attributes.

The product team selected 127 thousand new customers who did not respond to the survey to participate in a campaign, in which they will receive the offer of the new health insurance product. The offer will be made by the sales team through telephone calls.

However, the sales team has the capacity to make 20 thousand calls within the campaign period.

# 2. Business Assumptions.

The dataset presents customers from Pakistan. The curency presented by the source is Rs, Pakistani rupee.
Every client in the database is above minimum driving age.
For all customers, the vintage is less than one year.

# 3. Solution Strategy

My strategy to solve this challenge was:

**Step 01. Data Description**

**Step 02. Feature Engineering**

**Step 03. Data Filtering**

**Step 04. Exploratory Data Analysis**

**Step 05. Data Preparation**

**Step 06. Feature Selection**

**Step 07. Machine Learning Modelling**

**Step 08. Hyperparameter Fine Tunning**

**Step 09. Convert Model Performance to Business Values**

# 4. Top 3 Data Insights

**Hypothesis 01: Who was previosly insured is less likely to acquire a new insurance service**

**True**

**Hypothesis 02: The higher Annual Premium, the lower interest in insurance*

**False.**

**Hypothesis 03: The higher age, the higher interest in insurance*

**True**

# 8. Conclusions

By making 20.000 calls, which translates to about 26% of our base list, we would be able to reach about 65% of the clients who would like to purchase our insurance services.

By making 25.100 calls, which translates to about 33% of our base list, we would be able to reach about 80% of the clients who would like to purchase our insurance services.
